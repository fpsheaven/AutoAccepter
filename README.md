# CS2 Automated Game Accepting method
A python app that accepts your game when you are away.

YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET VAC BANNED FOR USING THIS APP.

This app interacts purely with your computer and NOT the game :)

## Installation

Download the installer from [here](https://github.com/fpsheaven/AutoAccepter/edit/main/launcher.bat) and run the bat file only one time.

## Usage

```python
Run the executable from C:\AutoAccept

```
Press P to start the recognition.

The app will start taking captures of your primary monitor and save them on the TEMP dir on windows.

Each capture is compared with the screenshot provided on the folder.

If the app finds a match, it will click the middle of the screen where the accept button is located.
